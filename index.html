        Hello! I wish to apply for the Digital Manager role at Oestro Generation ~
        <br><br>
        My name is Hen & I am a trans fem / non binary freelance web developer at the beginning of their journey -
        I really think I can help you generate graphics / update the site ect. 
        If you would like to have 3D graphics in Web GL like in the CV page below I can do that too! (click on spheres for things, best viewed on PC / although there is mobile functionality)
        <br><br>
        My hope is that I can in some small way help to educate the world on trans lives and perspectives in a fun and engaging way, as I believe the cis hets have hope if only they can empathise with us. 
        Hopefully together we can conquer fear.
